Lem-in project
We should launch ants through the farm. Each room contains just one ant at time. They needs to use small amount of steps as possible. Of-course we have start and the end of farm where can stay any quantity of ants.
Some issues: your program doesn't print commets.It just accept and doesn't send to the standard-output.
There are more than three operations (quantity of steps) in the big-superposition test.
Our program applies more than one time ##start and ##end. We should reject repetitions.
There is not bonus part. We've got 94/100
